# Weekly Challenge 1

## Description

The motivation behind this weekly challenge was about using HTML, CSS, and Git to refactor code given to us. The goal of this was to simulate an on the job ticket or feature request by a boss or client. We were to follow a format that is typical to software teams in the field which is agile development, using items such as User Stories, Acceptance Criteria, and Mock Ups to complete the task. Once that was completed, we were to deploy those changes to GitHub pages. 

In this specific challenge, we contacted by a marketing angency that wanted to update or refactor their existing codebase to ensure it follows modern day accessibility standards and helps with search engine optimization (SEO). They provided some acceptance criteria along with a picute mockup to make sure their needs are met accurately. On top of that, I made sure to follow the scout rule which is centered around leaving the code you are working with cleaner than it originally was when you found it. Additionally, I checked for improvements within the codebase such as making sure all links functioned and improved the effeciency of the HTML/CSS by consolodating redundancies. The main acceptance criteria were as follows:
- Sournce code must have semantic HTML elements
- The structure of the HTML elements must follow a logical structure independent of stlying and positoning
- Comments before each element or section of the page
- All icon and image elements must have alt attributes
- All heading attributes must fall in sequential order
- Must have a concise and descriptive title

The main goal this problem would solve is the marketing companies codebose becomes more optimized and accessible wihtin modern day standards. Another thing that was achived is their codebase has now become more readable after we refactored it by consolidating the CSS code for redundancies while also adding specific comments for readability in the future. 

Through this first challenge, I learned multiple hands on skils that will be used within the modern software development lifecycle and environment. Through this on the job ticket/feature request, I was able to put my skills to the test with HTML, CSS, Git and the full Git flow.
